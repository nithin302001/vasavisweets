iam GitHub (/ˈɡɪthʌb/) is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[8] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[9]

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[10] As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers[11] and more than 420 million repositories,[12] including at least 28 million public repositories.[13] It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023. Over five billion developer contributions were made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024.[14]

About
Founding
The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2005.[15][16][17] The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release.[18] Its name was chosen as a compound of Git and hub.[19]

Structure of the organization
GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management.[20] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries.[21]

In 2014, the company added a layer of middle management in response to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership. As a result of the scandal, Tom Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.[22] Co-founder and Product lead, Chris Wanstrath, became CEO. Julio Avalos, then General Counsel and Administrative Officer, assumed control over GitHub's business operations and day-to-day management.[23]

Finance
GitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[24]

In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital[8] with a $750 million valuation.[25]

In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[26][27] The company was then valued at approximately $2 billion.[28]

As of 2023, GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue annually. hbukhfcyitubhdcnhxyjfgyhnckjb xs

History
The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., was formed in 2007 and is located in San Francisco.[29]

On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.

That same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,[30] and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[31]

In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[32] A year later, this number doubled.[33] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[34] On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[35] By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching 10 million repositories.[36]

In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside of the U.S.[37]

On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third-largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.[38]

On June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.[39][40]

Acquisition by Microsoft

Microsoft was on top of the list of the ten organizations with the most open-source contributors on GitHub in 2016.[41]
From 2012, Microsoft became a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and the bulk of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs).[42][43]

On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion (~$8.96 billion in 2023). The deal closed on October 26, 2018.[44] GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business.[45] Under Microsoft, the service was led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. Nat Friedman resigned November 3, 2021; he was replaced by Thomas Dohmke.[46]

There have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at Open-Xchange over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions, such as Nokia's mobile business and Skype.[47][48]

This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger focus on cloud computing services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source software.[9][43][49] Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base, so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage the use of its other development products and services.[50]
